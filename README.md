Project: Airbnb Analysis

Problem Statement: This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

Approach:

1. Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset. Perform queries and data retrieval operations to extract the necessary information for your analysis.

2. Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary.

3. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.


4. Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps. Visualize the distribution of listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

5. Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

6. Investigate how the price of listings varies across different locations. Visualize these insights on interactive maps or create dashboards in tool like Power BI.

7. Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences. Enable users to interact with the visualizations to explore specific regions, property types, or time periods of interest.

8. Utilize Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
